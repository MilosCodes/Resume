        <h2>My life:</h2>
            <p>My name is Milosh, i have finished college, since i have been working as iOS/macOS dev, it't not my first time coding. The Thing is... There was a huge issues and problems i had in my private life... since i was battling unexpected death of my father... returning his credit.... fixing the problems within my family... I was caught slacking my my job as developer. I haven't seen my self in that job, also on of my best friends saw that. He was trying to help me, but i kept drowning. Short story i have lost my job since he didin't know how to handle me, and i had bad taste in my mouth for coding. But i have managed to set my self free and working two jobs to provide for my family. In free time i was studying and became a teacher in school... Finished college afterwards, and now i have more free time to get back for what i am passionate about, and that's is to code.</p>
